Health data sets (real life) from a Samsung Health device are analyzed in this project. The data is randomly retievied. There are six datasets - heart rate, step count, sleep, floors climbed, exercise and summary. We try and check if the data has no patterns or if they correspond to a particular type of individual - using exploratory analysis. The analyzed data is then showcased on a flask app where users can create a user id and login.
